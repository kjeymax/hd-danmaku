1
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,220
Senior brother, witness
the true Swallow Skims Clouds.

2
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,200
Impressive qinggong.

3
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,180
Let Ouyang Fei trade blows.

4
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:32,860
We’ll trap a turtle in a jar.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:37,980
Luo Qiutong’s heartless.

6
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:44,260
Senior brother—
can we survive tonight?

7
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:47,900
Surrender now—

8
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:50,180
or it’s death.

9
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:46,540
Oh no!

10
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,420
Oh!

11
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,420
Lord Guan—
Zheng Dongting’s sword is divine.

12
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,540
Our sects’ brothers

13
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:00,300
can’t break through.

14
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,420
Wound salve’s running low.
Keep fighting, and the Arrest Alliance must order from Jiangnan Apothecary.

15
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,380
Our funds were wiped out.

16
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:15,740
Pond Master Yu Yaoxia has arrived!

17
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,220
Pond Master—

18
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:24,300
long journey.

19
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,020
Lord Guan—

20
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,300
too kind.

21
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,260
Fought all night—
not one death.

22
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,900
Zheng Dongting pulls his strikes.

23
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,420
He’s just sly.

24
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:39,700
Wounded enough

25
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:41,440
to drain our medicine.

26
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:43,140
No one dares charge.

27
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,340
He lingers a bit longer.

28
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:49,660
Lord Guan’s right.

29
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,040
I’ve relayed the message—
they’re here.

30
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,260
So quick?

31
00:03:54,800 --> 00:03:58,620
Pond Master—
world’s top qinggong.

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,180
Compared to Zheng Dongting,

33
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:03,860
mine’s embarrassing.

34
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:10,140
Too humble.

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:12,140
After tonight,

36
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:15,980
no one outruns you.

37
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,060
Thanks for the reward, Hall Master Guan.

38
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:31,800
Junior brother—

39
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:34,260
thinking of Qiutong?

40
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,660
Knew it.

41
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Senior brother—

42
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:44,180
If I die in Shezhou,

43
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,300
will Qiutong mourn me?

44
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,780
Say that to me, fine—

45
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:51,620
don’t tell outsiders.

46
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:52,940
I have face.

47
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,820
Zheng Dongting, Zu Beiqiu—

48
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:58,220
one last chance.

49
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,540
Bind yourselves and surrender.

50
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,740
The Arrest Alliance will summon elders for trial.

51
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,820
We’ll give you justice.

52
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:07,860
Pah!

53
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:10,860
Divine Hand breeds fleeing heroes—

54
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:12,700
no bound cowards.

55
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:14,980
Then—

56
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:18,660
today’s your death day.

57
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:24,660
Senior brother—

58
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:28,220
who’re you thinking of? Me?

59
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,640
Bro—

60
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:40,020
Hahahahaha!

61
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,500
My eleventh concubine.

62
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:56,480
Oh!

63
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,700
Senior brother—what?

64
00:06:13,480 --> 00:06:15,060
Donors—

65
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,380
sins committed,

66
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,540
where to flee?

67
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:22,300
Bitter sea boundless—

68
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,620
turn back to shore.

69
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:26,960
Come on!

70
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,500
Amitabha.

71
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:06,380
Buddha’s mercy.

72
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:31,740
Senior brother—someone’s catching up!

73
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,580
So huge

74
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,400
yet so agile.

75
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:54,560
Please—

76
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:13,940
Ah!

77
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,740
Ah!

78
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:21,780
Senior brother—

79
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,940
still alive?

80
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:28,380
Bad luck.

81
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,660
Even Nephew Lian changed his mind.

82
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:47,340
Perfect.

83
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,640
If Zheng Dongting gets desperate

84
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,300
and risks his kung fu—

85
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:56,520
we’ll need Nephew Lian too.

86
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:59,340
No need now.

87
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:54,580
Please—

88
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:57,660
I swear never to use seven sects’ arts.

89
00:10:09,640 --> 00:10:11,200
He’s holding back.

90
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,580
Wait—with his skills, how’d he massacre the Luo clan?

91
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:17,780
No one saw him strike.

92
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,100
You only saw

93
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,780
him toss their banner into the fire.

94
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,860
Did I misjudge?

95
00:10:25,160 --> 00:10:27,460
Luo massacre wasn’t him.

96
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,820
That’s what he wants.

97
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:32,360
No witnesses—

98
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,660
he denies forever.

99
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,600
If he fights now,

100
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,620
he’s trapped.

101
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,580
Divine Hand disciples—

102
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:45,180
ruthless and sly.

103
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:55,360
Arhat—

104
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,420
Arhat Formation.

105
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,440
Something new.

106
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,240
Runs on the array eye—

107
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,460
that’s the flaw.

108
00:11:09,280 --> 00:11:11,180
You know how to break it?

109
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,680
Master hated Arhat Formation.

110
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:18,340
No clue why.

111
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,440
Beiqiu—remember it.

112
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:26,620
Teach those monks for me.

113
00:11:29,280 --> 00:11:30,000
Who’s the eye?

114
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:33,180
They swap often—let me see.

115
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:44,920
Long-browed monk—

116
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,580
lips moving. Him.

117
00:12:11,240 --> 00:12:12,820
Senior brother—switched!

118
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:13,980
Big monk—

119
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,020
eyes darting.

120
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:19,600
Switched!

121
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,860
Little old man.

122
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:40,780
Old man strength?

123
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,020
Senior brother—switched!

124
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:00,980
I know—I see.

125
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:06,100
Senior brother—that’s not it!

126
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:08,320
You said darting eyes—

127
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,180
cross-eyed always look like that.

128
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:11,600
Hey!

129
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:33,820
Junior brother—untie the ropes! Ah!

130
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:40,100
Junior brother—Minor Formless Skill!

131
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:57,220
Ah!

132
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,300
Senior brother—I can’t hold it!

133
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,220
What demon art?

134
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,980
Well done.

135
00:15:14,040 --> 00:15:15,700
Why let them go?

136
00:15:15,960 --> 00:15:17,540
Masters are wise—

137
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,860
know when to stop. Mercy.

138
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,080
Lord Guan—

139
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,940
next move?

140
00:15:36,840 --> 00:15:39,120
Pond Master—have scouts

141
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:41,500
track the twin terrors.

142
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:44,340
Sure—but extra pay.

143
00:15:47,840 --> 00:15:54,140
We’ve lost all face for the sects.

144
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:59,180
Lord Guan—wild idea:

145
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:02,040
Gui Xiang Brothel?

146
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:02,840
What?

147
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,940
Insane?

148
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:08,340
But they rushed there urgently.

149
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,060
Men, you know.

150
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:15,820
Brother Ouyang—no impure thoughts.

151
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:17,400
Qi sinks,

152
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,320
channels clog—

153
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:19,620
harder to move.

154
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,660
Nephew Lian—what’s your view?

155
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,820
Zheng Dongting’s swift—

156
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,540
headed to Lingnan.

157
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,900

to Yizhou.

160
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:46,380
Invite the Zu family to Xuzhou’s Kill Prestige Hall.

161
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:47,900
Yes, Lord Guan.

162
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,140
No—don’t harm families!

163
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,700
No choice.

164
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:55,220
Luo clan slaughtered whole—

165
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:06,020

Where you from?

169
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,540
Old Master Zu—

00:17:22,560 --> 00:17:24,300
your son’s in trouble.

Hero Gang’s secret.

00:17:30,920 --> 00:17:32,220

00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,420
Who dares fight in Yizhou?

179
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:49,500
Dare dance here?

180
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,860
Zu Gui—grab blades.

181
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,900
To Xuzhou—collect debt.

182
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,980
Senior brother—slow down!

183
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:20,400

185
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,460
Can’t eat it.

186
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:29,620
Chocolate joy—don’t go!
