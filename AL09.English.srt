1
00:00:35,566 --> 00:00:37,100
Let’s continue repairing together

2
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,600
Hero, let me help you

3
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,833
ah

4
00:02:32,900 --> 00:02:33,700
ah

5
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,100
ah

6
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:39,833
ah

7
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,600
What happened to the Seventh Senior Brother?

8
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:57,200
I was in crisis as soon as I woke up

9
00:02:57,933 --> 00:03:00,000
Uh-huh

10
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,066
It's too late for you to say that, huh?

11
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,100
The Lord of the Six Paths said that the troops should be divided into two groups.

12
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:08,233
Sure enough, Zhang Yuanshan and Miss Jiang are not here.

13
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,800
Why do I have to be connected with this poker?

14
00:03:11,933 --> 00:03:14,100
If only I could team up with Miss Jiang

15
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:16,266
Talking and laughing along the way

16
00:03:16,333 --> 00:03:17,833
that would be nice

17
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,066
Forget it, that's all

18
00:03:21,066 --> 00:03:23,500
Let me first slap the poker face on you and apologize.

19
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:25,633
Hahahaha, senior brother Qin

20
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:27,833
I saw you were looking graceful just now

21
00:03:27,933 --> 00:03:30,666
It seems that the Long River Sunset Sword Technique has achieved some success.

22
00:03:31,733 --> 00:03:32,800
No strong enemy

23
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,266
Dare not agree

24
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:37,000
That’s eight more words

25
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,233
What if you were a robot talking and wasting electricity?

26
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:48,033
Hahahahahaha, God is so powerful

27
00:03:48,666 --> 00:03:50,900
Shen Sang knows that his name is Xiang Hui

28
00:03:51,266 --> 00:03:52,933
Please also be kind to me

29
00:03:52,933 --> 00:03:54,066
Take good care of yourself

30
00:03:54,466 --> 00:03:56,433
Uh haha

31
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,500
Let’s go to Jinchan Temple

32
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:02,666
Do you want to go with us or by yourself?

33
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:07,200
Of course, that little guy is following the holy monk closely.

34
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:09,433
I'm waiting for you

35
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:11,800
You just showed off your magical powers

36
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,466
Fall into the Tiger Taming Flying Palace

37
00:04:13,466 --> 00:04:15,833
That's it. Okay, okay, okay.

38
00:04:15,933 --> 00:04:17,366
you're almost done

39
00:04:18,133 --> 00:04:19,800
don't leave me

40
00:04:22,733 --> 00:04:23,633
Why

41
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:27,400
If you are willing to follow, that is

42
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,900
These two people must be a burden with them.

43
00:04:32,366 --> 00:04:34,066
But I want to introduce the emperor list again before

44
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,733
If Miss Jiang hadn’t disdained my low martial arts skills,

45
00:04:36,733 --> 00:04:39,966
If you take care of me all the way, I'm afraid I'll go to the West long ago

46
00:04:43,266 --> 00:04:45,300
I don’t know how he is doing now.

47
00:04:53,266 --> 00:04:54,833
This should be the last few

48
00:04:55,133 --> 00:04:56,066
Without further ado

49
00:04:56,366 --> 00:04:58,500
Let’s set off quickly to Chaohua Mountain

50
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:02,166
Will the little monk and the others be okay?

51
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:04,400
The truth is no longer what it used to be

52
00:05:04,733 --> 00:05:06,500
What's more, there are knights delivering

53
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,666
no need to worry

54
00:05:15,733 --> 00:05:17,566
It’s a long way to Shaohua Mountain

55
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:19,866
Several assassins came on horseback just now

56
00:05:19,866 --> 00:05:21,000
Just available

57
00:05:21,766 --> 00:05:23,200
The journey is quite long

58
00:05:23,333 --> 00:05:24,133
His senior brother

59
00:05:24,133 --> 00:05:26,300
Could it be that we already know the location of Shaohua Mountain?

60
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,833
This place is the only way for Huahua Sect to go to Jinchan Temple.

61
00:05:31,166 --> 00:05:32,366
This road is smooth

62
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:35,366
It takes at least five days to go up Shaohua Mountain

63
00:05:35,933 --> 00:05:36,966
There is another shortcut

64
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,566
But forced to sit southbound

65
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:41,866
Could it be that the geographical environment of this world

66
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:44,233
It’s the same as the world we live in

67
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:48,700
There is only one way to go

68
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:11,066
What happened to the little benefactor?

69
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,900
master me

70
00:06:14,166 --> 00:06:16,900
I don’t know how to ride this?

71
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,266
Master, can I learn to ride?

72
00:06:23,733 --> 00:06:25,233
don't leave me

73
00:06:26,166 --> 00:06:26,966
Why

74
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:32,800
Hey, donor, if you don’t mind

75
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,866
You can pay for it with me

76
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:35,500
Um

77
00:06:36,733 --> 00:06:38,466
let him sit behind me

78
00:06:38,466 --> 00:06:40,400
What if he plots against me like in the TV series?

79
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,233
Grandmaster

80
00:06:42,933 --> 00:06:44,366
Hey boy girl

81
00:06:44,366 --> 00:06:45,800
You'd better sit in the front

82
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:48,633
Xiaoseng is worried that you will be thrown away, huh?

83
00:06:57,733 --> 00:06:58,633
Amitabha

84
00:06:58,733 --> 00:06:59,300
Color is empty

85
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:00,233
Empty without color

86
00:07:00,333 --> 00:07:01,000
Form is empty

87
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,066
Emptiness is form

88
00:07:03,366 --> 00:07:04,166
So

89
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,400
ah

90
00:07:06,100 --> 00:07:07,666
We'd better leave quickly

91
00:07:07,733 --> 00:07:09,833
Let's catch up with Brother Cavalry and the others.

92
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:28,500
Seventh Senior Brother

93
00:07:29,066 --> 00:07:30,866
There is one more thing that bothers me

94
00:07:31,466 --> 00:07:33,533
Are you worried about the mission of Allah of the Six Paths?

95
00:07:33,533 --> 00:07:34,333
good

96
00:07:34,866 --> 00:07:36,166
As the mission says

97
00:07:36,166 --> 00:07:38,633
All the way to Houdao Jinzen Temple will be obliterated

98
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,766
Could it be that we and Miss Jiang and the others cannot have both?

99
00:07:43,133 --> 00:07:44,200
The rules are established

100
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,666
It’s useless to think too much

101
00:07:50,900 --> 00:07:51,700
holy monk

102
00:07:52,666 --> 00:07:54,266
It’s important that we hurry up

103
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:55,833
another team

104
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,566
He will definitely try his best to get ahead of us

105
00:07:58,666 --> 00:08:00,066
Wait until they enter Jinzen Temple

106
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,866
We can't go to the West anymore.

107
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:06,433
There must be some other way

108
00:08:22,133 --> 00:08:23,000
Seventh Senior Brother

109
00:08:23,200 --> 00:08:25,900
After traveling for so long, how far is Huashan?

110
00:08:27,133 --> 00:08:28,966
Can keep up with Seventh Senior Brother

111
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:32,466
Actually, you can say two more words per sentence

112
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,966
Hey, look at this trial mission

113
00:08:34,966 --> 00:08:36,200
You must have a bitter look on your face

114
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,066
Have to do it too

115
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,800
You have a smile on your face, so let’s do it too, right?

116
00:08:40,133 --> 00:08:42,166
Then why don't you smile?

117
00:08:42,166 --> 00:08:43,366
relax

118
00:08:43,366 --> 00:08:44,766
What about your swordsmanship?

119
00:08:44,766 --> 00:08:46,066
Wouldn't it be a better chance of rebirth?

120
00:08:47,966 --> 00:08:49,966
Hey dear mother

121
00:08:50,266 --> 00:08:52,500
Am I a counselor for autistic children?

122
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,066
Hahahahaha

123
00:08:57,066 --> 00:08:59,200
What the holy monk said is absolutely true

124
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,166
What you said is absolutely true, hahaha

125
00:09:02,866 --> 00:09:04,200
Amitabha

126
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:06,933
The so-called everything gained

127
00:09:06,933 --> 00:09:08,233
All from the beginning

128
00:09:08,333 --> 00:09:10,866
Seventh Brother, we must learn to smile

129
00:09:11,533 --> 00:09:14,566
A senior once said that when you smile

130
00:09:14,566 --> 00:09:17,333
The world will fall in love with you, this lovelorn world

131
00:09:17,333 --> 00:09:18,766
What if he falls in love with us?

132
00:09:18,766 --> 00:09:21,066
Then can’t we accomplish this task?

133
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,300
I feel very relaxed

134
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:30,400
My face was born like this

135
00:09:31,066 --> 00:09:32,266
It's going to rain

136
00:09:32,333 --> 00:09:33,666
Find a place to take shelter from the rain

137
00:09:38,166 --> 00:09:40,000
Little monk, come here

138
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:43,833
If the mission issued by the Lord of Six Paths

139
00:09:43,966 --> 00:09:45,466
Aligned with your bottom line

140
00:09:45,733 --> 00:09:46,866
So what?

141
00:09:56,166 --> 00:09:57,500
as you said before

142
00:10:00,666 --> 00:10:01,900
Now we have Senior Brother Zhang

143
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,500
They probably must have

144
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:08,366
Are you willing to kill for them?

145
00:10:11,566 --> 00:10:12,900
Become a Buddha immediately

146
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:20,900
At the last minute

147
00:10:21,466 --> 00:10:22,700
Naturally you will know

148
00:11:31,466 --> 00:11:32,500
Seventh senior brother

149
00:11:32,733 --> 00:11:34,000
What did you just say?

150
00:11:34,166 --> 00:11:36,266
Smiling in the face of a passionate kiss, right?

151
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:39,100
At this time, you still have to joke casually

152
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:42,366
It just shows that our path is in the right direction.

153
00:11:42,766 --> 00:11:43,966
This heavy rain is pouring

154
00:11:44,133 --> 00:11:45,866
I got wet and couldn't put a few things in my spare time.

155
00:11:45,933 --> 00:11:47,800
I'm afraid there will be a close fight next.

156
00:11:47,866 --> 00:11:51,266
Force me to stay here and deal with them again.

157
00:11:52,866 --> 00:11:53,866
Junior Brother Truth

158
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,633
This place is not far from Jinzen Temple

159
00:13:04,166 --> 00:13:05,800
It should be safe in front

160
00:13:06,600 --> 00:13:08,100
Don't take it lightly

161
00:13:08,900 --> 00:13:11,366
Brother Zhang, tell me

162
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,000
If we had really arrived at Jinzen Temple earlier,

163
00:13:16,366 --> 00:13:18,233
What should the little monks do?

164
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,866
The gun captain still has time to care about others

165
00:13:21,766 --> 00:13:23,766
I've been really unlucky for eight lifetimes

166
00:13:23,766 --> 00:13:25,400
Why did you come to this damn place?

167
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:21,800
hey what is

168
00:14:28,933 --> 00:14:30,600
He is not human

169
00:15:18,366 --> 00:15:21,066
Ansheng is afraid of being killed by the dead

170
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,700
yeah

171
00:17:00,133 --> 00:17:04,033
When the clouds disperse, is there anyone waiting?

172
00:17:57,566 --> 00:17:59,466
Let me sweep across

173
00:18:07,000 --> 00:18:09,966
Burn the road again and make it salty

174
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:13,266
can also feel it
