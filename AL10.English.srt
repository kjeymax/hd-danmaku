1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,300
Let’s continue repairing together

2
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:13,466
Seventh Senior Brother, are you okay?

3
00:02:14,133 --> 00:02:15,600
We have to get into the mountains as soon as possible

4
00:02:15,866 --> 00:02:16,933
Many enemies escaped

5
00:02:16,933 --> 00:02:18,300
Afraid of help coming

6
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:25,700
Also look for the bodies of Xiao Hui and Xiaozi.

7
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:28,033
I'm afraid the two of them will meet each other

8
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,466
Master

9
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:38,800
Boy, girl, are you okay?

10
00:02:40,533 --> 00:02:42,033
They're all here to attack you

11
00:02:42,100 --> 00:02:43,600
Are you injured?

12
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,400
I'm lying on the ground and no one is paying attention to me.

13
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:50,433
As long as you're fine

14
00:02:53,166 --> 00:02:55,866
Oh, I'm so lucky that you two are protecting each other.

15
00:02:56,100 --> 00:02:59,000
I think we will arrive at Jinzen Temple soon.

16
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:00,566
You're fine too

17
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:02,000
your face

18
00:03:02,566 --> 00:03:04,466
Haha, just a minor injury

19
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:06,600
After being stabbed, he fainted and fell to the ground.

20
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,500
But take a life

21
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:11,033
If I had known I would have pretended to be dead

22
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,266
Let's go. It's getting late.

23
00:03:13,566 --> 00:03:16,800
Let’s find a place to rest first, hahaha

24
00:03:20,166 --> 00:03:21,666
The three-day period is getting closer and closer

25
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:25,300
I don’t know where Miss Jiang and Senior Brother Zhang are.

26
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,266
Little monk, don't come here

27
00:03:29,466 --> 00:03:31,033
Don't arouse me

28
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,766
Little monk

29
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:41,000
Master, we have to prepare to go down the mountain.

30
00:03:42,066 --> 00:03:43,633
The rumor is at the foot of the mountain next door

31
00:03:45,466 --> 00:03:47,500
master me

32
00:03:48,566 --> 00:03:50,000
Are you talking in your sleep?

33
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,600
Are you calling Xiao Sang?

34
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,600
Master, please be careful in the future

35
00:03:57,600 --> 00:03:59,466
A girl named Gu Xiaosang

36
00:03:59,733 --> 00:04:02,200
He is the baddest, baddest villain in the world

37
00:04:02,266 --> 00:04:03,100
Oh why

38
00:04:03,866 --> 00:04:05,800
All in all, very bad, very bad

39
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,366
Kill without blinking an eye

40
00:04:08,600 --> 00:04:11,366
It will be completed for three days at Haishi today.

41
00:04:11,733 --> 00:04:12,566
not much time

42
00:04:12,566 --> 00:04:13,633
Set off quickly

43
00:04:25,733 --> 00:04:26,766
The gentleman has passed

44
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,166
Hurry up the mountain

45
00:04:32,666 --> 00:04:33,466
Excuse me

46
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,833
What do you mean?

47
00:04:35,866 --> 00:04:38,400
The situation with Miss Jiang and Senior Brother Zhang is unknown now.

48
00:04:38,866 --> 00:04:40,466
If we go up the mountain and enter the temple

49
00:04:40,733 --> 00:04:42,366
Wouldn't it be putting them to death?

50
00:04:42,733 --> 00:04:46,166
But maybe they were already ahead of us.

51
00:04:46,166 --> 00:04:47,000
yes

52
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,933
And the Northern Barbarian army will not stop and wait for us.

53
00:04:49,933 --> 00:04:52,266
Yes, everything you mentioned is sick.

54
00:04:52,766 --> 00:04:54,233
In both our hands

55
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,733
It's like holding a control

56
00:04:55,733 --> 00:04:57,100
The organ of life and death of the opponent

57
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,366
In order to prevent the other party from pressing it first

58
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:00,500
the only way

59
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,466
Just be that ruthless person first

60
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:04,500
But I believe in Miss Jiang and Senior Brother Zhang

61
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:06,266
They will also believe us

62
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:10,000
It's barely enough for the spider to meet the boy.

63
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:14,600
If Brother Seventh also insists on going up the mountain, I'm afraid

64
00:05:16,066 --> 00:05:17,000
Seventh Senior Brother

65
00:05:17,066 --> 00:05:19,600
You asked me before if I was willing to kill myself as an adult

66
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:21,966
This moment is my answer

67
00:05:22,933 --> 00:05:25,066
What is the real plan?

68
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,000
If we wait for someone in this huge Shaohua Mountain

69
00:05:29,066 --> 00:05:31,033
I will definitely choose a conspicuous place

70
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:33,666
If it were Miss Jiang, they would definitely think so too.

71
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,366
You go to the temple gate first

72
00:05:35,466 --> 00:05:38,066
Maybe Miss Jiang and the others are already waiting for us there.

73
00:05:38,733 --> 00:05:40,666
I'll check privately to see if there are any other clues

74
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,300
It’s still like there was no news before

75
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:46,800
Then we'll keep it private

76
00:05:48,166 --> 00:05:50,800
Aren't you afraid that I'll go ahead with them two privately?

77
00:05:52,366 --> 00:05:52,800
six paths

78
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,266
Since it is said that the team that arrives first will complete the task

79
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,766
Then there is a possibility

80
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,600
It is necessary for all the surviving team members to be present.

81
00:05:59,766 --> 00:06:02,100
and i believe you

82
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:04,366
Haha

83
00:06:25,466 --> 00:06:27,266
Several people described by senior brother

84
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,066
Really no impression

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,633
Oh, it's getting late already

86
00:06:32,766 --> 00:06:34,666
But since I'm not obliterated yet

87
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,600
They must be waiting for me somewhere

88
00:06:36,700 --> 00:06:39,566
Miss Jiang, I will definitely find you

89
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:43,366
Could it be that the master is also a friend in the world of martial arts?

90
00:06:43,366 --> 00:06:45,300
Are you here to help Jinzen Temple?

91
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,666
The donor knows that there are other people who come here to have a destiny

92
00:06:48,666 --> 00:06:50,300
In Xiahe Luo Wei Wuji

93
00:06:50,366 --> 00:06:52,200
Come to Shengyuan Jinchan Temple from all walks of life

94
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:53,900
The heroes who resisted the Manchus

95
00:06:53,933 --> 00:06:57,600
Now everyone is gathering at the mountain inn within the inn

96
00:07:01,933 --> 00:07:03,666
30 years of Luohe wine

97
00:07:03,866 --> 00:07:05,166
Mellow and fragrant

98
00:07:05,533 --> 00:07:06,400
Indeed extraordinary

99
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:08,200
It's a pity that the world is in chaos

100
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:11,666
The time to enjoy tea and wine with peace of mind is running out.

101
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:15,566
The way of the world is extremely victorious and will eventually lead to death and rebirth.

102
00:07:15,666 --> 00:07:18,133
We need to remain useful

103
00:07:18,133 --> 00:07:19,633
for recovery

104
00:07:20,733 --> 00:07:22,966
Mr. Zhang’s insights are indeed extraordinary

105
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:25,600
Brothers got together

106
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:28,600
They were responsible for this Manchu invasion.

107
00:07:28,666 --> 00:07:29,633
glo boil

108
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:33,200
There are heroes with high moral character and high prestige who rush to protect heroes.

109
00:07:33,333 --> 00:07:34,900
I look at that catechu

110
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:36,200
Abundance as a tool

111
00:07:38,566 --> 00:07:39,366
Why

112
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:42,466
Among these highly respected heroes

113
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,233
I'm afraid there's you, Master Wei.

114
00:07:44,466 --> 00:07:45,933
Ha ha ha ha

115
00:07:45,933 --> 00:07:47,866
No soup, no soup

116
00:07:47,866 --> 00:07:50,400
You two gentlemen, what would you like to eat?

117
00:07:50,866 --> 00:07:52,633
Uh-huh

118
00:07:53,466 --> 00:07:55,066
I have been studying martial arts for thirty years

119
00:07:55,766 --> 00:07:58,233
But it is worth noting that there is no way to innate the door

120
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,100
I told Mr. Zhang that I

121
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:02,200
The weak crown has broken through the innate

122
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:06,066
And this time, I went through many obstacles for the sake of Jin Chan.

123
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:08,966
Come here to report to Mr. Zhang

124
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,133
There

125
00:08:11,133 --> 00:08:13,766
He was saying goodbye to Young Master He Luomen and was learning how to taste tea.

126
00:08:13,766 --> 00:08:16,400
You guys should talk about the old days first

127
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,400
A little tired in the middle of the night

128
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,966
I'm going to order some shit.

129
00:08:25,866 --> 00:08:26,833
Let’s talk about it when we come

130
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,166
ah

131
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,433
Who is this monk?

132
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:34,166
Can monks also drink alcohol?

133
00:08:36,366 --> 00:08:38,566
The dead man knew Mr. Zhang

134
00:08:39,366 --> 00:08:41,700
Is he also some kind of film and television master?

135
00:08:44,733 --> 00:08:45,633
Do it first to respect

136
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,200
Oops

137
00:08:48,700 --> 00:08:49,733
Forget my body

138
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,700
He is a monk who only eats vegetarian food.

139
00:08:54,366 --> 00:08:55,233
For real

140
00:08:55,733 --> 00:08:57,200
Don’t talk about the commandments

141
00:08:57,200 --> 00:08:59,566
You shouldn’t be so reckless when you drink for the first time

142
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,400
Don’t know the taste of strong liquor

143
00:09:01,966 --> 00:09:05,266
How can a young monk understand the value and necessity of precepts?

144
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,000
Yeah, no exception

145
00:09:07,133 --> 00:09:08,366
I've been waiting for you for a long time

146
00:09:08,966 --> 00:09:10,333
The zombie girl was right

147
00:09:10,333 --> 00:09:13,200
As expected, you are also looking for our gun girl.

148
00:09:15,966 --> 00:09:16,833
little monk

149
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:19,466
You came

150
00:09:28,333 --> 00:09:29,566
Even Miss Jiang

151
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:31,900
Who is this person?

152
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,200
Junior Brother Zhending

153
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,800
He is the disciple of his mentor and good friend

154
00:09:35,133 --> 00:09:37,266
Nicknamed the Leaf-cutting Buddha Knife

155
00:09:39,533 --> 00:09:40,766
This is a trick

156
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,000
It turns out that he is also an expert outside the world.

157
00:09:44,566 --> 00:09:45,866
You are so stingy at your age

158
00:09:46,966 --> 00:09:50,366
He's young but he's got a lot of tricks up his sleeve

159
00:09:53,866 --> 00:09:55,633
His senior brother is waiting for us at the gate of the temple

160
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,033
Without further ado

161
00:09:57,066 --> 00:09:58,200
Let's go quickly

162
00:10:05,966 --> 00:10:06,900
Seventh Senior Brother

163
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,566
Seventh Junior Brother

164
00:10:15,533 --> 00:10:16,566
Where is the boy?

165
00:10:17,766 --> 00:10:21,266
Oh, it's convenient to go to the master

166
00:10:23,733 --> 00:10:25,066
You are finally back

167
00:10:25,066 --> 00:10:27,200
Hahaha I'm really nervous now

168
00:10:27,700 --> 00:10:30,300
I'm afraid it's not that easy to die.

169
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:36,600
Mistress has a way

170
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:43,433
who

171
00:10:44,366 --> 00:10:45,833
Breaking into Jinzen Temple without authorization

172
00:10:45,933 --> 00:10:48,033
Don't blame us for being rude.

173
00:10:48,166 --> 00:10:50,666
Senior brother, I am Zhending from a miscellaneous hospital.

174
00:10:50,666 --> 00:10:52,700
You don’t recognize me anymore

175
00:11:00,666 --> 00:11:02,833
Wanwan looked at what he was wearing

176
00:11:03,066 --> 00:11:04,666
It's true that they destroyed the hospital.

177
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:05,966
do you know

178
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,766
I don’t know you then

179
00:11:08,766 --> 00:11:10,266
Meet uh

180
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:12,233
Do you know me or not?

181
00:11:12,866 --> 00:11:13,966
This is the kind of senior brother

182
00:11:15,133 --> 00:11:17,400
I met these donors on the road

183
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,100
I learned there was a shocking conspiracy

184
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,666
We must report it to the abbot as soon as possible

185
00:11:20,933 --> 00:11:22,833
Brother, please let them in

186
00:11:25,566 --> 00:11:26,866
Thank you for your hard work, junior brother

187
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:27,700
Come in quickly

188
00:11:27,700 --> 00:11:28,800
Don't delay the business

189
00:11:38,733 --> 00:11:40,766
Even if you arrive at Jinchan Temple

190
00:11:41,333 --> 00:11:43,500
Once the main mission is completed

191
00:11:43,966 --> 00:11:46,466
Each person will be rewarded with 50 good deeds

192
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:51,200
Mission 2: Hold on to the golden toad until the last moment

193
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,466
Success reward 100 good deeds

194
00:11:53,733 --> 00:11:55,633
Otherwise erase

195
00:11:56,333 --> 00:11:58,400
we we did it

196
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:01,400
no one was wiped out

197
00:12:02,566 --> 00:12:03,866
we did it

198
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,833
Well, who are you?

199
00:12:10,300 --> 00:12:11,500
Ahhh

200
00:12:11,733 --> 00:12:12,533
Everyone

201
00:12:12,566 --> 00:12:15,400
I'm waiting to get the list of Duocate tea restaurants.

202
00:12:15,666 --> 00:12:16,800
It's urgent

203
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,300
He also asked to see the scheming master's strange behavior and behavior.

204
00:12:20,366 --> 00:12:21,800
I look at you like it's hard

205
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,966
let them in

206
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,300
Master Deguang, eh

207
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:33,100
Is this Zhang Shaoxia who killed Guan Haoran?

208
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,766
Chang Ha Fang has heard about it for a long time

209
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:39,566
Please come with me

210
00:12:43,666 --> 00:12:46,233
Several donors risked their lives to retaliate

211
00:12:46,666 --> 00:12:48,766
I am very grateful

212
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,266
This road is really dangerous

213
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,566
Fortunately, he lived up to his expectations

214
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,866
Finally got this urgent information

215
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,100
Brought to the abbot

216
00:12:57,366 --> 00:12:58,433
ah

217
00:13:05,133 --> 00:13:06,666
Temptation of mortal world

218
00:13:06,766 --> 00:13:10,466
Monks who are always monastics are not immune to this

219
00:13:10,966 --> 00:13:13,466
There was a traitor in the temple after all.

220
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:16,833
I really want to thank you all this time.

221
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,633
Master Abbot’s magical skills are unparalleled

222
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:21,300
Defeat all doubts

223
00:13:21,466 --> 00:13:23,833
I'm just icing on the cake.

224
00:13:24,533 --> 00:13:27,566
The power of Duocatecha is unpredictable

225
00:13:28,933 --> 00:13:31,666
I just wanted to give up my remaining body

226
00:13:31,766 --> 00:13:34,266
It’s just the determination not to fear life and death.

227
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:35,400
Fang Chang promises to be extremely hateful

228
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,600
Never keep a useful person

229
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,900
Come to the future with pictures

230
00:13:40,466 --> 00:13:42,100
Amitabha

231
00:13:43,533 --> 00:13:45,900
As monks you are

232
00:13:45,900 --> 00:13:48,866
Why can't you see through this stupid sentence?

233
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,800
Then go die

234
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,466
Xiaohui

235
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:07,500
Hahahaha, the general asked me to say hello to the abbot.

236
00:14:12,266 --> 00:14:13,266
So fast

237
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,166
He is a versatile scholar

238
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,966
The ever-changing scholar

239
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Could it be that

240
00:14:20,533 --> 00:14:23,366
What's going on with Xiang Hui, little monk?

241
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,400
I'm afraid he is no longer Xiang Hui.

242
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:29,866
The real Xiang Hui was in our woods when we were previewing

243
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:31,633
Already killed by this ever-changing scholar

244
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,233
What's the use of being stronger?

245
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:48,666
You're not being fooled around by me

246
00:14:48,966 --> 00:14:51,266
Hahahahaha

247
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:59,433
If the beating continues, I won't be able to escape immediately.

248
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:04,433
careful

249
00:15:05,333 --> 00:15:06,466
Extraordinary

250
00:15:07,166 --> 00:15:09,233
There is a wonderful synergy with the eight parts of body and mind

251
00:15:22,133 --> 00:15:23,900
Boundless sea of ​​suffering

252
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:27,100
The donor has not turned around yet.

253
00:15:28,366 --> 00:15:30,400
Ha ha ha ha

254
00:15:31,266 --> 00:15:34,233
If Master Abbot can lead Zhongtou City

255
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:38,166
The general will surely make Jinchan Temple the first Buddhist temple

256
00:15:38,333 --> 00:15:39,833
Incense continues

257
00:15:40,266 --> 00:15:41,400
otherwise

258
00:15:42,533 --> 00:15:44,666
Thousand-year foundation of Jinchan Temple

259
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,900
Will be destroyed in half

260
00:15:47,666 --> 00:15:49,666
Amitabha

261
00:15:49,966 --> 00:15:52,800
My thousand-year foundation of Jinchan Temple

262
00:15:53,100 --> 00:15:56,966
Only in the mansion, the Zen battle is about to begin

263
00:15:57,400 --> 00:15:58,466
Forgive me

264
00:15:59,133 --> 00:16:00,900
Can't stay behind

265
00:16:01,700 --> 00:16:03,266
Do you dare to commit murder?

266
00:16:04,166 --> 00:16:06,366
Buddha has a compassionate heart

267
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:09,233
There are also King Kong nightmares

268
00:16:12,866 --> 00:16:14,366
Straight line Ren Wuyi

269
00:16:14,500 --> 00:16:18,733
Kill the ever-changing scholar Zhang Yuanshan Zhending

270
00:16:18,733 --> 00:16:20,466
Reward 30 good deeds

271
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,400
Qi Zhengyan Jiang Zhiwei

272
00:16:23,466 --> 00:16:25,433
Each reward is 20 bows

273
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:27,800
Straight line mission 2 starts

274
00:16:28,333 --> 00:16:29,900
kill the general

275
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:31,633
The flowers are long

276
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:34,000
Square Anthurium

277
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:34,866
Anthurium

278
00:16:35,566 --> 00:16:36,366
ah

279
00:16:37,666 --> 00:16:38,900
You spies

280
00:16:39,133 --> 00:16:40,666
What else is there?

281
00:16:41,766 --> 00:16:44,466
No, they are spies

282
00:16:45,466 --> 00:16:50,800
I'm afraid I've passed away just now.

283
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:54,233
His origin as a benefactor is unclear

284
00:16:54,933 --> 00:16:56,066
extraordinary moment

285
00:16:56,066 --> 00:16:58,033
Please leave the temple early

286
00:16:58,133 --> 00:17:00,066
We traveled through mountains and rivers to save Jinchan Temple

287
00:17:00,066 --> 00:17:01,366
But this suspicion

288
00:17:01,766 --> 00:17:03,666
Could it be that other consciousnesses came from the mountains?

289
00:17:03,666 --> 00:17:04,566
Chilling?

290
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:10,833
So I'll take my leave first.

291
00:17:10,933 --> 00:17:12,466
If anyone can help

292
00:17:12,466 --> 00:17:13,766
Please ask the abbot for instructions

293
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,866
Companion Revenant

294
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:17,600
Please also ask the abbot to supervise
