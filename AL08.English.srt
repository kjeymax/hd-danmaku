1
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,366
Let’s continue repairing together

2
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:28,600
careful

3
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:31,366
Ahhh

4
00:02:32,333 --> 00:02:33,300
ah

5
00:03:01,066 --> 00:03:02,866
Dalian's iron cloth shirt can't be torn

6
00:03:02,866 --> 00:03:05,066
Why does the strength increase so quickly?

7
00:03:25,533 --> 00:03:26,333
ah

8
00:03:31,266 --> 00:03:32,666
Magic Box Touching Fist

9
00:03:41,266 --> 00:03:44,033
Who did you fight with just now?

10
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,633
behind the back

11
00:03:46,866 --> 00:03:48,366
Miss Senior Brother

12
00:03:48,366 --> 00:03:49,566
I'll go find him

13
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:51,966
then then that tree

14
00:03:51,966 --> 00:03:53,366
He's at that door

15
00:03:54,300 --> 00:03:56,566
Oops, report back to Uncle Master

16
00:03:56,933 --> 00:03:58,033
we patrol here

17
00:03:58,366 --> 00:03:59,666
But on the cliff

18
00:03:59,666 --> 00:04:01,700
Saw Zhenguan coming out of a secret door

19
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:03,833
Then he attacked us without any explanation.

20
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,866
Go on

21
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,166
I'm afraid all the details about my lady will be exposed.

22
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,200
That figure

23
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:20,400
It is indeed the Zhenguan disciple who was expelled from the mountain gate before.

24
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:21,566
Recognize his face

25
00:04:22,333 --> 00:04:25,266
But I always feel like there are some strange changes in him

26
00:04:25,766 --> 00:04:26,666
Um

27
00:04:28,066 --> 00:04:29,633
You guys go back to the Monk Monastery first.

28
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:31,900
Just leave it to me here

29
00:04:31,966 --> 00:04:33,433
It's Uncle Master, Uncle Master

30
00:04:34,700 --> 00:04:37,666
Oh, thank you so much, uncle, for helping me just now

31
00:04:42,366 --> 00:04:43,166
ah

32
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:46,833
It turns out that this is the strength that is close to the peak of outdoor scenes.

33
00:04:53,666 --> 00:04:55,700
So handsome oops

34
00:04:55,900 --> 00:04:57,766
It scared me to death just now

35
00:04:57,766 --> 00:05:00,100
Fortunately, Xuanbei Shishu arrived in time

36
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,900
xuanbei poetry book

37
00:05:02,933 --> 00:05:05,066
Yes, that was Master Xuanbei just now

38
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,266
I heard a senior brother mentioned it before

39
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,766
Is he great?

40
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:11,666
Master Xuanbei

41
00:05:11,666 --> 00:05:12,466
It's Xuanzi quilt

42
00:05:12,466 --> 00:05:14,833
The first eminent monk to step into the eighth layer of the outdoor scene

43
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,900
Only one step away from the peak

44
00:05:17,566 --> 00:05:19,500
Exterior view of Eighth Heaven

45
00:05:21,566 --> 00:05:24,800
Brother, I really want to become such a master

46
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,200
Brother, you can definitely be gentle.

47
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,000
Just got beaten

48
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:29,700
The bones are falling apart

49
00:05:36,566 --> 00:05:38,300
Are you two okay?

50
00:05:38,766 --> 00:05:41,233
The signal just now was sent by you

51
00:05:41,933 --> 00:05:45,000
Xuanxin means that Zhenguan just appeared in the back mountain

52
00:05:45,166 --> 00:05:46,400
surprise attack on us

53
00:05:46,866 --> 00:05:47,666
Zhenguan

54
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:49,600
Why is he here?

55
00:05:50,066 --> 00:05:51,900
I do not know

56
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,933
Thanks to Master Xuanbei for helping me

57
00:05:53,933 --> 00:05:56,166
I guess I've chased him by now

58
00:05:57,366 --> 00:05:58,166
Why

59
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,566
When you go down the mountain, you still have the chance to start over again.

60
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:05,233
Why is Zhenguan so obsessed with staying here?

61
00:06:06,933 --> 00:06:08,466
Just be fine

62
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:10,066
Just be fine

63
00:06:10,366 --> 00:06:12,766
You two, hurry up and catch up with me.

64
00:06:17,966 --> 00:06:20,166
I wasn’t Master Xuanxin a few days ago

65
00:06:20,166 --> 00:06:22,600
Did you drive Senior Brother Zhenguan down the mountain in person?

66
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:24,100
Why are you back now?

67
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,000
Don't know

68
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:26,966
Go back first

69
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:27,966
Oh, right

70
00:06:27,966 --> 00:06:30,800
You have to compete with Senior Brother Zhenmiao tomorrow

71
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:38,466
Where did he get the confidence to challenge Brother Zhenmiao again?

72
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,566
Just a handyman

73
00:06:41,266 --> 00:06:42,566
An evil monk

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:44,666
I won against Senior Brother Zhenliang last time

75
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:46,366
I think it's purely a coincidence

76
00:06:47,066 --> 00:06:49,900
Hey, you still have some skills, huh?

77
00:06:50,133 --> 00:06:51,800
I don’t know how high the sky is and how high it is

78
00:06:52,866 --> 00:06:55,033
Ahhh

79
00:06:56,333 --> 00:06:57,800
Ah, senior brother

80
00:06:57,933 --> 00:07:00,200
Why is Master Xuanbei here too?

81
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,666
The contempt of Brother Zhenmiao and Zhending

82
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,166
It was spread throughout the hospital

83
00:07:04,166 --> 00:07:05,866
Could Senior Brother Xuanbei not know?

84
00:07:05,866 --> 00:07:06,566
I guess

85
00:07:06,566 --> 00:07:09,033
He also wanted to come and see with his own eyes the true strength.

86
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:12,166
Please give me some advice, Brother Zhenmiao.

87
00:07:12,266 --> 00:07:13,466
You make the first move

88
00:07:54,733 --> 00:07:56,766
No, can't give up

89
00:07:57,766 --> 00:07:58,566
Plastic surgery

90
00:08:04,966 --> 00:08:05,766
Senior brother

91
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,433
I haven't given up yet

92
00:08:34,900 --> 00:08:36,500
Ahhh

93
00:08:37,066 --> 00:08:39,600
Ahhh

94
00:08:42,333 --> 00:08:43,133
ah

95
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,500
ah

96
00:08:49,566 --> 00:08:50,866
I don't even recognize it

97
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,633
It's Senior Brother Zhenchang

98
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,433
Senior Brother Zhenchang is back

99
00:08:56,500 --> 00:08:57,466
back again

100
00:08:59,133 --> 00:09:01,700
Ah, he is Senior Brother Zhenchang

101
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:02,600
Um

102
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,266
Senior Brother Zhenzhen who is truly prepared by the three major disciples

103
00:09:06,333 --> 00:09:08,633
Some time ago he passed through Tongren Lane

104
00:09:08,766 --> 00:09:10,966
Became the youngest wandering disciple

105
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,400
It's just a discussion between brothers

106
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,000
Remember the key points till now

107
00:09:17,966 --> 00:09:19,033
Thanks for the teaching, senior brother

108
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:21,700
Sorry, junior brother

109
00:09:24,900 --> 00:09:25,766
uncle

110
00:09:26,766 --> 00:09:28,900
I'm really sure of the move this guy just used.

111
00:09:28,900 --> 00:09:30,666
The five-story courtyard didn’t teach it at all.

112
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:33,033
Where did he learn this secretly?

113
00:09:33,733 --> 00:09:34,666
really

114
00:09:35,866 --> 00:09:37,800
His few steps were weird

115
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:39,233
Never seen it before

116
00:09:39,266 --> 00:09:41,700
Does our golden cicada have such a move?

117
00:09:41,700 --> 00:09:44,966
Could it be that the theft of Zangxing Pavilion had something to do with him?

118
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,200
Why are there people everywhere who like to make snitches?

119
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:56,766
I have seen the Xuanbei history book

120
00:09:57,533 --> 00:10:00,000
You must ask where you learned the Eight Immortals

121
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:01,366
can not say

122
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,000
I can only take one step and see one step.

123
00:10:04,266 --> 00:10:05,466
Your pace

124
00:10:06,166 --> 00:10:07,700
Where did you get it from?

125
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:11,466
Returning poems and books on xuanbei is a family tradition

126
00:10:11,733 --> 00:10:14,866
Before becoming a monk, the disciple had been exposed to many ancestral martial arts

127
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:17,600
On weekdays, when I have nothing to do, I will practice

128
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,966
Wow, it seems he believes it

129
00:10:26,266 --> 00:10:27,166
Hum ok

130
00:10:27,766 --> 00:10:29,366
Too scheming

131
00:10:29,666 --> 00:10:31,066
Talking wildly

132
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:34,266
You will be punished by facing the wall for 3 days

133
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:37,600
For today’s written test, let’s not do the counting first.

134
00:10:44,133 --> 00:10:46,033
Brother, are you okay?

135
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,666
Let's go, I'll be locked up

136
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,666
It will be great now that the normal senior brother is back

137
00:11:01,466 --> 00:11:04,066
Why did Senior Brother Zhenchang come with you?

138
00:11:04,866 --> 00:11:07,766
Maybe you're afraid that if I don't go to confinement, I'll take the opportunity to escape.

139
00:11:07,766 --> 00:11:09,433
Ha ha

140
00:11:13,866 --> 00:11:15,033
I don't like excitement

141
00:11:16,266 --> 00:11:18,500
Dare I ask my junior brother’s dharma number?

142
00:11:18,600 --> 00:11:19,700
Report back to senior brother

143
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,200
The Dharma Name is True

144
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:24,600
poetry calligraphy

145
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:27,500
You are facing the wall just to give everyone an explanation

146
00:11:28,066 --> 00:11:29,900
You don't have to take it too seriously

147
00:11:31,566 --> 00:11:32,766
I do not mind

148
00:11:33,100 --> 00:11:34,200
got used to

149
00:11:35,166 --> 00:11:38,800
Hey, senior brother, where did you go during this wandering trip?

150
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,633
First time traveling down the mountain

151
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:41,900
Not far to go

152
00:11:41,966 --> 00:11:43,666
The farthest is only as far as Jiangzhou City

153
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,733
Ah, senior brother

154
00:11:45,733 --> 00:11:47,866
What is there in Jiangzhou city?

155
00:11:48,766 --> 00:11:50,366
Gu Huaizhi, who is on the top of the earth rankings

156
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,466
He is the lord of Jiangzhou City

157
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,466
Jiangzhou City was built on the riverside

158
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:56,400
Looks like a giant dragon from a distance

159
00:11:56,866 --> 00:11:58,500
There are even eight levels and nine trees in the city.

160
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,766
Heavy traffic

161
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:04,033
Since coming to this world

162
00:12:04,133 --> 00:12:06,600
I haven’t been anywhere yet.

163
00:12:06,866 --> 00:12:09,566
I don’t know if there will be a chance in the future.

164
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,633
But no matter how nice it is outside

165
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,600
It's just a mirror, a flower in the water, a moon in the water

166
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,900
Not as relaxed as in Jinchan

167
00:12:20,566 --> 00:12:22,200
We are well fed and clothed in the temple.

168
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,433
You can also practice kung fu

169
00:12:23,533 --> 00:12:25,000
Why are you going out?

170
00:12:49,533 --> 00:12:50,833
Wall facing three blades

171
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:52,900
I’m worried that I can’t find a place to practice alone.

172
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,500
Opportunity for the Eight Steps of Divine Walking

173
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:07,466
Ha, I’m finally a little more proficient.

174
00:13:45,566 --> 00:13:46,833
Little monk takes orders

175
00:13:54,566 --> 00:13:56,266
Isn’t martial arts making a lot of progress?

176
00:13:57,666 --> 00:14:00,700
The young monk doesn’t want to see the Buddha in his prime.

177
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,066
I know you are at Jinchan Temple

178
00:14:03,066 --> 00:14:04,766
A street where it’s hard to get a sharp edge

179
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,433
So I prepared some for you

180
00:14:06,733 --> 00:14:09,366
I have to thank Miss Jiang for that.

181
00:14:09,666 --> 00:14:10,533
I knew it

182
00:14:10,533 --> 00:14:13,000
Miss Jiang still thinks that I am really my junior brother.

183
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:14,033
Stay safe

184
00:14:17,266 --> 00:14:18,766
Senior Brother Zhang and Senior Brother Qi

185
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:23,233
New people will join this mission

186
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,833
Ah hey

187
00:14:37,066 --> 00:14:39,000
What is this place

188
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,266
You, who are you?

189
00:14:41,766 --> 00:14:42,933
What to look at

190
00:14:42,933 --> 00:14:44,233
I'll kill you

191
00:14:50,533 --> 00:14:52,166
why am i here

192
00:14:54,600 --> 00:14:56,300
Sample tricks

193
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,500
Junior Brother Zhending’s skills have really improved rapidly.

194
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,900
Dare to ask this master

195
00:15:10,166 --> 00:15:12,266
What's going on?

196
00:15:13,566 --> 00:15:14,600
What to bet on?

197
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:16,166
Tell me if you have a bet

198
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:17,166
Hahaha

199
00:15:17,500 --> 00:15:19,400
Several of you should have noticed the difference here.

200
00:15:19,400 --> 00:15:20,266
It’s normal now

201
00:15:20,700 --> 00:15:23,866
The poor monk is not much different from you.

202
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:26,466
I just came to this trial time a while ago

203
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:32,066
Trial World

204
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:37,000
I'm here to find out if there's any other way out of here.

205
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:41,266
master master

206
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:44,066
Master, please, boy.

207
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,966
elementary school girl

208
00:15:48,266 --> 00:15:51,200
The little girl has no power to tie the chicken

209
00:15:51,666 --> 00:15:53,766
But Feng Yu talks about the Lord of Six Paths

210
00:15:53,900 --> 00:15:55,166
let me go back

211
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,666
I will keep my word

212
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,966
Why is this woman so abnormal?

213
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,966
LOL

214
00:16:02,133 --> 00:16:03,266
Amitabha

215
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:07,033
Donor, do you think I have the final say?

216
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:10,400
master master

217
00:16:10,666 --> 00:16:12,033
Please love me

218
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:19,300
Ahhh

219
00:16:21,533 --> 00:16:22,133
Lord of the Six Paths

220
00:16:22,133 --> 00:16:24,333
I really got an ordinary girl who doesn’t know how to do martial arts.

221
00:16:24,333 --> 00:16:25,133
ah

222
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,500
ah

223
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,300
ah

224
00:16:36,266 --> 00:16:38,200
Task started

225
00:16:39,866 --> 00:16:41,833
The Northern Barbarians took over the Central Plains

226
00:16:42,066 --> 00:16:44,800
Taoism goes against the teacher and slaughters the people

227
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:48,066
The monks of Jinchan Temple rose up to resist

228
00:16:48,166 --> 00:16:51,033
General fruit catechu to scare martial arts

229
00:16:51,133 --> 00:16:53,966
Place an eyeliner in Jinzen Temple

230
00:16:54,266 --> 00:16:57,633
Lead many masters to Shaohua Mountain

231
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,566
Encirclement and Suppression of Jinchan Temple

232
00:17:00,200 --> 00:17:01,833
Main mission one

233
00:17:02,266 --> 00:17:04,633
The troops were divided into two groups to break through and intercept

234
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:08,866
Send the internal list to Jinzen Temple within three days

235
00:17:09,733 --> 00:17:13,066
Later, he was obliterated all the way to Jinzen Temple.

236
00:17:13,566 --> 00:17:15,233
Those who have not been treated within the time limit

237
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:22,200
Each person who successfully enters the temple will be rewarded with 50 good deeds.

238
00:18:54,366 --> 00:18:56,233
Let me sweep across

239
00:18:59,066 --> 00:19:00,866
young heartbeat

240
00:19:07,466 --> 00:19:08,666
you know
